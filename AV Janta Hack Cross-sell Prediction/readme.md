This competition was held in September of 2021. 
This was a imbalanced classification problem. 
The best results were given by CatBoost, Neural Network, XGBoost and LightGBM.
I had to use Oversampling of minority class and Undersampling of majority class to get a good AUC score. Class weights were not as accurate.
